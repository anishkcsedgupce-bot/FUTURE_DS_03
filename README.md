## Internship Track
Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics (DS)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze marketing funnel data to identify
conversion drop-offs at each stage, evaluate marketing channel performance,
and provide data-driven recommendations to improve lead-to-customer
conversion rates.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains marketing funnel information such as website visits,
leads generated, qualified leads, customers acquired, and marketing channels
including social media, email, and paid advertisements.

## Analysis Performed
- Cleaned and prepared the marketing funnel dataset
- Calculated conversion rates and drop-off percentages at each funnel stage
- Analyzed channel-wise performance and conversion efficiency
- Identified key funnel stages impacting overall conversion

## Key Insights
- Major drop-off observed between lead generation and customer conversion
- Email marketing shows higher conversion efficiency compared to other channels
- Social media generates high traffic but relatively lower final conversions
- Mid-funnel stage contributes to the highest leakage

## Recommendations
- Optimize landing pages and call-to-action to improve lead conversion
- Increase focus on high-performing channels such as email marketing
- Implement retargeting strategies for dropped leads
- Improve lead nurturing through personalized communication

## Conclusion
